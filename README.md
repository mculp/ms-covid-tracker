# Mississippi COVID Tracker

http://ms-covid-tracker.herokuapp.com/

## Rationale

The State of Mississippi provides a daily table with the latest counts of total COVID cases and deaths in each county. The table doesn't show counties' new cases or deaths. This project scrapes the table each day and compares to the previous day's table to provide new cases and deaths in each county. The tables are stored so there is also a historical view of the data.

## API

All data can be accessed in JSON format.
